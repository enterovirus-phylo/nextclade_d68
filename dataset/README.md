## Scope of this dataset

This dataset uses the Fermon reference sequence ([AY426531.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY426531.1)), originally isolated in 1962. It provides a framework for quality control, clade assignment, and mutation calling across global EV-D68 diversity.

The reference may differ substantially from recent circulating strains, particularly in genogroups B and D.

## Features

This dataset supports:

- Genogroup assignment (A–D) based on phylogenetic structure
- Strict quality control including frame shift detection
- Alignment, mutation calling, and placement in a curated phylogenetic tree
- Use with full genome or full VP1 sequences

## Genogroups of Enterovirus D68

EV-D68 is divided into genogroups A (A1-A2), B (B1–B3), C, and D, widely used in molecular epidemiology. These are phylogenetically defined and support regional and global surveillance of respiratory outbreaks.

As with other enteroviruses, there is no standardized lineage system. Genogroup naming follows established studies and surveillance practice.

## What is a Nextclade dataset?

A Nextclade dataset includes the reference sequence, genome annotations, tree, clade definitions, and QC rules. Learn more in the [Nextclade documentation](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/stable/user/datasets.html).
