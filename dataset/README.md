## Scope of this dataset

Based on the full genome sequence, this dataset uses the Fermon reference sequence ([AY426531.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY426531.1)), originally isolated in 1962. It provides a framework for quality control, clade assignment, and mutation calling across global EV-D68 diversity.

***Note:** The Fermon reference is substantially diverged from currently circulating strains. This is common for many enterovirus datasets, in contrast to some other virus datasets (e.g., seasonal influenza) where the reference is updated more frequently to match recent sequences.*


## Features

This dataset supports:

- Assignment of subgenotypes
- Phylogenetic placement
- Sequence quality control (QC)

## VP1 protein annotation correction  

The VP3 and VP1 protein boundaries have been updated to match the true structural organization:  
- The first 12 amino acids previously annotated as VP1 are now correctly assigned to the C-terminus of VP3.  
- This change follows structural analyses ([Fang *et al.*, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104992)).  
- All VP1 protein numbering is shifted by **–12** relative to legacy annotations.

## Subgenogroups of Enterovirus D68

EV-D68 is divided into subgenogroups A (A1-A2), B (B1–B3), and C. 

These designations are based on phylogenetic structure and are widely used in molecular epidemiology, similar to subgenotype systems for other enteroviruses.  
Unlike influenza (H1N1, H3N2) or SARS-CoV-2, there is no universal, standardized global lineage nomenclature for enteroviruses — naming follows conventions from published studies and surveillance practice.

## What is a Nextclade dataset?

A Nextclade dataset includes the reference sequence, genome annotations, tree, clade definitions, and QC rules. Learn more in the [Nextclade documentation](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/stable/user/datasets.html).
